# The Root of Evil

Entry for GGJ2023

Editor used: 2022.1.1

The game is designed for "Tholos" semi-spherical Virtual Reality theatre of "Hellenic Cosmos" (http://www.tholos254.gr/en/), the Cultural Centre of the Foundation of the Hellenic World. Anyone who wishes to check out the game can do so by using Unity's main camera, however, keep in mind that the camera has been set up for the "Tholos" and isn't convenient to check out the game from it and won't provide an appreciative experience.
